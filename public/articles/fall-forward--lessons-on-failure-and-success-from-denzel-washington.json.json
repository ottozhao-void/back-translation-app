      "en": "In a powerful commencement address delivered at the University of Pennsylvania, Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington shared life lessons not from his successes, but from his failures. His central message, \"Fall Forward,\" challenges the conventional wisdom of playing it safe and encourages us to embrace risk as a necessary step toward greatness.",
      "zh": "在宾夕法尼亚大学一场充满力量的毕业典礼演讲中，奥斯卡奖得主、演员丹泽尔·华盛顿分享的人生教训并非来自他的成功，而是源于他的失败。他传达的核心信息——“向前跌倒”——挑战了“求稳为上”的传统智慧，鼓励我们将冒险视为通往卓越的必要步骤。"

      "en": "Washington critiques the common advice to \"have something to fall back on.\" He argues that preparing for failure with a safety net only prepares you to quit. Instead, he urges us to **\"Fall Forward\"**—meaning that if you fail, you should fail while reaching for something. By falling forward, you can at least see what you are about to hit. This mindset shifts the perspective of failure from a dead end to a part of the forward momentum.",
      "zh": "华盛顿批评了常见的“留条后路”建议。他认为，用安全网为失败做准备，只会让你准备放弃。相反，他敦促我们 **“向前跌倒”**——这意味着即使失败，也应在奋力争取时失败。通过向前跌倒，你至少能看清自己将撞上什么。这种心态将失败的视角从死胡同转变为前进动力的一部分。"

Success requires taking risks and venturing into the unknown. He shares his own vulnerability, recounting a time he auditioned for a Broadway musical and failed miserably because he couldn't sing. Years later, he returned to that exact same theater to star in the play *Fences*, winning a Tony Award. The lesson: **\"You hang around the barbershop long enough, sooner or later you're going to get a haircut.\"** Persistence pays off.",
      "zh": "借用著名的“九点谜题”作类比，华盛顿提醒我们，解决问题的唯一方法往往是突破自我设定的想象边界。成功需要冒险并探索未知领域。他坦露自身脆弱经历，回忆曾试镜百老汇音乐剧却因不会唱歌而惨败。多年后，他重返同一剧院主演《藩篱》，并赢得托尼奖。其启示在于：**“在理发店待得够久，迟早会剪上头。”** 坚持终有回报。"

Whether one’s talent is in medicine, business, or the arts, the true measure of success is how those talents are used to aid others. He leaves the audience with a Japanese proverb that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of resilience: **\"Fall down seven times, get up eight.\"**",
